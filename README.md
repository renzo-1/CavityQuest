**Introduction**
Cavities are a common dental problem that can cause pain, infection, and tooth loss. Early detection and treatment of cavities is important to prevent these complications. However, traditional methods of cavity detection, such as visual inspection by a dentist, can be time-consuming and inaccurate.
The proposed solution is to create a cavity detection AI tool that can use YOLOv7, Electron, Python, Django, and cloud service to detect cavities in teeth. YOLOv7 is a deep learning object detection model that can be used to detect objects in images. Electron is a framework that can be used to create cross-platform desktop applications. Python is a programming language that is well-suited for machine learning tasks. Django is a web framework that can be used to create web applications. Cloud service can be used to store and process data.

A dataset of images of teeth with and without cavities will be collected.
The images will be pre-processed to remove noise and improve the quality of the data.
YOLOv7 will be trained on the pre-processed images.
The trained YOLOv7 model will be used to detect cavities in new images.
An Electron app will be created to allow users to upload images of teeth and detect cavities.
The Electron app will be deployed to the cloud.

**Results**
The results of the proposed solution will be evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: The accuracy of the cavity detection model will be measured by the percentage of images that are correctly classified as having or not having cavities.
Precision: The precision of the cavity detection model will be measured by the percentage of images that are classified as having cavities that actually have cavities.
Recall: The recall of the cavity detection model will be measured by the percentage of images that actually have cavities that are classified as having cavities.
